## Philosophy   
Science should be reproducible and one of the best ways to achieve this is by logging research activities in a notebook. Because science/biology has increasingly become computational, it is easier to document computational projects in an electronic form, which can be shared online through Github.    

### Helpful features of the notebook     

**It is absolutely critical for your future self and others to follow your work.**     

* The notebook is set up with a series of internal links from the table of contents.    
* All notebooks should have a table of contents which has the "Page", date, and title (information that allows the reader to understand your work).     
* Also, one of the perks of keeping all activities in a single document is that you can **search and find elements quickly**.     
* You can document anything you'd like, aside from logging your research activities. For example:
	* feel free to log all/any ideas for your research project([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#page-39-2016-06-13-post-doc-project-idea-assessing-current-impacts-of-climate-change-in-natural-populations)) as an entry,     
	* or write down notes for a paper([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#id-section36).      

* Lastly, you can share specific entries because of the three "#" automatically creates a link when the notebook renders on github.
